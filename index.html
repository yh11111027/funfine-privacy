## Privacy Policy

### Introduction

Welcome to **FunFine** ("we," "our," "the App"). FunFine is a playful household notice tracking application designed to help roommates, couples, and housemates gamify household friction management through friendly notices and settlements.

Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how FunFine handles your information.

### Our Privacy Commitment

**FunFine is 100% local-first.** All your data is stored exclusively on your device. We do not collect, transmit, store, or process any of your personal information on external servers. No cloud sync. No remote backups. No data sharing.

### Information We Do Not Collect

FunFine does **NOT** collect, transmit, or store:

- ❌ Personal identifiable information (name, email, phone number)
- ❌ User accounts or authentication credentials
- ❌ Location data or GPS coordinates
- ❌ Device identifiers or advertising IDs
- ❌ Usage analytics or behavioral tracking data
- ❌ IP addresses or network information
- ❌ Contacts, calendar, or other system data
- ❌ Any data transmitted to external servers

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device

The following information is stored **exclusively on your device** using local storage technologies (localStorage and IndexedDB):

#### User-Generated Content
- **Zone Names:** Names you assign to your supervision zones (e.g., "Apartment 404")
- **Member Information:** Nicknames you create for household members (e.g., "Roommate A," "Boyfriend")
- **Notice Records:** 
  - Violation descriptions and types
  - Compensation amounts (monetary or labor-based)
  - Settlement status and timestamps
  - Supervisor titles you customize
- **Photos:**
  - Evidence photos captured via camera or uploaded from your photo library
  - Generated notice receipt images
  - Verification/redemption QR code images you upload
- **Settings:**
  - Language preference (English or Simplified Chinese)
  - Active zone selection

#### Data Storage Location
- **localStorage:** Zone configurations, members, notices (text data only)
- **IndexedDB:** Photo blobs and image cache
- **iOS Photo Library:** Only when you explicitly choose to save notice images (requires permission)

### Automatic Data Management

#### Photo Auto-Cleanup
To preserve your device storage, FunFine automatically deletes evidence photos **30 days after a notice is marked as settled**. This cleanup runs automatically when you launch the app. You will see warnings in the app reminding you to save important photos before automatic deletion.

#### Manual Data Control
You have full control over your data:
- **Export Data:** Export all zones, members, and notices as a JSON backup file
  - ⚠️ **Note:** Exported backups contain text records only. Photos are NOT included in exports.
- **Delete Notices:** Remove individual notices and their associated photos
- **Delete Zones:** Permanently delete entire zones and all related data
- **Clear Photo Cache:** Manually clear all stored photos via Settings

### Permissions

FunFine requires the following **optional** iOS permissions:

#### Camera Access
- **Purpose:** To capture evidence photos for violation notices
- **When Requested:** When you tap "Take Photo" while creating a notice
- **Optional:** You can skip photo capture or upload existing photos instead

#### Photo Library Access (Read)
- **Purpose:** To select and upload existing photos as evidence
- **When Requested:** When you tap "Upload Photo" while creating a notice
- **Optional:** You can skip or use camera instead

#### Photo Library Access (Write)
- **Purpose:** To save generated notice images to your Photos app
- **When Requested:** When you tap "Save to Album" after creating a notice
- **Optional:** You can choose "Save Only" to keep images in-app without saving to Photos

**All permissions are optional.** The app remains functional even if you decline permissions.

### Third-Party Services

FunFine does **NOT** use:
- ❌ Analytics services (no Google Analytics, Firebase, Mixpanel, etc.)
- ❌ Advertising networks or tracking SDKs
- ❌ Cloud storage or database services
- ❌ Social media integrations
- ❌ Crash reporting services that transmit data

**FunFine operates 100% offline.** The app functions fully without an internet connection. All processing happens locally on your device.

### Data Sharing

We do **NOT**:
- Share your data with third parties
- Sell or rent your information
- Transmit data to external servers
- Use your data for advertising or marketing
- Access your data remotely

**You are in complete control.** Your data never leaves your device unless you manually export it or share screenshots.

### Children's Privacy

FunFine is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect or store information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the app, please contact us at **xiaowan19982024@163.com**.

### Data Retention

- **Notice Text Data:** Retained locally until you delete the notice, zone, or app
- **Evidence Photos:** Automatically deleted 30 days after notice is marked as settled
- **Cached Images:** Retained until manual cleanup or automatic purge
- **Exported Backups:** Stored as files on your device; you control retention
- **Upon App Deletion:** All local data (localStorage and IndexedDB) is automatically cleared by iOS

- ✅ **Right to Access:** View all your data via the app interface

- ✅ **Right to Delete:** Delete individual notices, zones, or all data

- ✅ **Right to Portability:** Transfer exported JSON to other devices or apps

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you exercise these rights directly through the app without needing to contact us.

### Security

- ✅ Keep your device secure with a passcode or biometric lock
- ✅ Be cautious when sharing notice screenshots (may contain personal photos/QR codes)
- ✅ Regularly back up important data using the export feature
- ✅ Obtain consent before photographing others as notice evidence
